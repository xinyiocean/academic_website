        <p>
            I am a master's student majoring in physical oceanography. 
        </p>
        <ul>
              <li>
                I'm passionate about technical issues oceanic and atmospheric research, including {identity.interestsTech}.
              </li>
              <li>
                I have general interests in {identity.interestsAcademic} and I'm still trying to figure out my major interest. 
              </li>
              <li>
                It's my goal to apply and develop advanced methods (e.g., machine learning) for ocean-related hazard forecasting and become an cross-disciplinary researcher.
              </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Besides scientific research, I'm an amateur guitar player, a song writer and a game developer.
            Maybe one day I'll produce my own album and publish my game. I'll definitely own 2 cats in 
            the future when I am settled down. Before that, I consider myself as a world traveller.
